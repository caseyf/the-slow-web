                <p>How long has it been since you looked at your phone? How long since you checked it for email? Do you feel it vibrate in the middle of the day, when nothing is even there? Can you ever let it go when something is?</p>
                <p>This is the Fast Web, an attention machine designed to keep you looking. And it&#39;s very good at what it does. Every day, smart and talented people work to make the things you love the most, and to make sure you&#39;re always paying attention to them.</p>
                <p>This isn&#39;t healthy, and we can do better. Welcome to the Slow Web. It&#39;s a collection of ideas, a rallying cry, to make clear that we aren&#39;t happy with the demands of our technology. We want to be in control, and to not feel pressured to clear every notification, empty every inbox, or reply to every @mention.</p>
